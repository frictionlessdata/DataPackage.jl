A Julia library for working with [Data Packages](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/).

### Status

:construction: This package is pre-release and under heavy development. We are first working on support for [Table Schema](http://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) in [tableschema-jl](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-jl). Please see [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-jl/blob/master/DESIGN.md) for a detailed overview of our goals, and visit the [issues page](https://github.com/frictionlessdata/tableschema-jl/issues) to contribute and make suggestions. For questions that need to a real time response, reach out via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/frictionlessdata/chat). Thanks! :construction:
